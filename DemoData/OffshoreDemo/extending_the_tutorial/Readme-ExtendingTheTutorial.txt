This tutorial may be extended with openly-accessible site measurements made available via marinedataexchange.co.uk.
Well documented cup-, as well fixed LiDAR based measurements located close to the demo site can be found under the links below.

The RaceBank met mast data:

a) More recent, but low-height (23m) measurements:

The file: race_bank_mm/ROW01_LoggerA_LoadSettings.xml contains load settings needed to easily get that data pack into WindFarmer. To do it navigate to Wind->Load measurement data, select the downloaded file and reference the settings file. Then click "Load".
Measurements within this datapack are at a relatively low-height (23 m amsl) as the mast was shortened during the operational phase.

b) 90m measurements from 2006-2008

The file: race_bank_mm/RB_processed_data_1_LoadSettings.xml contains load settings to load this data series into WindFarmer. However, the data are shared in excel format, with different campaign periods contained in separate sheets of the workbook. In order to load the data into WindFarmer using the attached settings one needs to copy the contents of each sheet into a separate text file (including on line with column headers) and load that into WFer.

A short, 3month LiDAR campaign from 2010-2011 is shared here:

The file: race_bank_mm/810ENGrbc10363_LoadSettings.xml contains load settting for the LiDAR data.

The NEWA mesoscale data:

A mesoscale time series (together with WindFarmer load settings) is also made available as part of this tutorial in the sub-folder newa_ts.It has been downloaded from the New European Wind Atlas, a free, web-based application developed, owned and operated by the NEWA Consortium.
