# Iterate scenarios in WindFarmer

Here is a python (or C#) script that may be run within the desktop application 
to iterate through all scenarios in the workbook and compute the full AEP.

The DemoData/OffshoreBalticCoast/BalticCoast.wwx workbook can be used as a 
test workbook.

Open this, import the script and run to export results to a folder per scenario
and to log the full yield.
